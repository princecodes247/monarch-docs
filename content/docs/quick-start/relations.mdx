## Introduction

Relations allow you to define how different schemas are connected to each other. By establishing relationships, you can easily manage and query related data across different collections.

For Example:

```typescript
    // Define schemas
    const _UserSchema = createSchema("users", {
      name: string(),
      isAdmin: boolean(),
      createdAt: date(),
      tutor: objectId().optional(),
      maybe: string().optional(),
    });
    const _PostSchema = createSchema("posts", {
      title: string(),
      contents: string(),
      author: objectId(),
    });

    // Define relations
    const UserSchema = _UserSchema.relations(({ one, ref }) => ({
      tutor: one(_UserSchema, "_id").optional(),
      posts: ref(_PostSchema, "author", "_id"),
    }));
    const PostSchema = _PostSchema.relations(({ one, many }) => ({
      author: one(_UserSchema, "_id"),
      editor: one(_UserSchema, "_id"),
      contributors: many(_UserSchema, "_id"),
    }));

    // Create database collections
    return createDatabase(client.db(), {
      users: UserSchema,
      posts: PostSchema,
    });

    await collections.posts
      .insertOne({
        title: "Pilot",
        contents: "Lorem",
        author: user._id,
        editor: user._id,
        contributors: [user2._id],
      })
      .exec();

    // Fetch and populate post's author using findOne
    const populatedPost = await collections.posts
      .findOne({
        title: "Pilot",
      })
      .populate({ author: true, contributors: true, editor: true })
      .exec();
```

In the example above, we define a User schema that can have a one-to-one relationship with another User (as a tutor) and a one-to-many relationship with Posts authored by the user. 
Similarly, the Post schema can reference the User schema for its author, editor, and contributors, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

## Types of references

The three types of relations in Monarch ORM are `one()`, `many()`, and `ref()`.

1. **one()**: This relation is used to define a one-to-one relationship between two schemas. 
   For example, in the User schema, a user can have one tutor, which is another user. 
   This is defined using the `one()` function, allowing you to easily navigate to the related user.

2. **many()**: This relation is used to define a one-to-many relationship. 
   In the Post schema, a user can be an author of many posts. 
   This is represented using the `many()` function, which allows you to retrieve all posts associated with a user.

3. **ref()**: This relation is used to create a reference to another schema. 
   In the User schema, the posts field references the Post schema, indicating that the posts are related to the user through the author field. 
   The `ref()` function helps in establishing this connection, enabling efficient data retrieval across schemas.

Understanding these relationships is crucial for structuring your data models effectively and ensuring smooth interactions between them.

## Populate


The `.populate()` method is a powerful feature that allows you to retrieve related documents from other collections based on defined relationships.
When you call `.populate()` on a query, it automatically fetches the related data for the specified fields, making it easier to work with complex data structures.

The `.populate()` method in Monarch ORM leverages MongoDB's `$lookup` aggregation stage under the hood to efficiently join documents from different collections.
When you call `.populate()` on a query, it constructs a `$lookup` operation that specifies the collection to join, the local field to match, and the foreign field in the referenced collection.

For example, if you have a `Post` schema that references a `User` schema for the `author` field, the `$lookup` operation will look something like this:
```
const lookupPostAuthor = {
  $lookup: {
    from: "users", // The collection to join
    localField: "author", // The field from the Post schema
    foreignField: "_id", // The field from the User schema
    as: "authorDetails" // The name of the new array field to add to the output documents
  }
};

const lookupPostContributors = {
  $lookup: {
    from: "users", // The collection to join
    localField: "contributors", // The field from the Post schema
    foreignField: "_id", // The field from the User schema
    as: "contributorDetails" // The name of the new array field to add to the output documents
  }
};

const lookupPostEditor = {
  $lookup: {
    from: "users", // The collection to join
    localField: "editor", // The field from the Post schema
    foreignField: "_id", // The field from the User schema
    as: "editorDetails" // The name of the new array field to add to the output documents
  }
};

```
