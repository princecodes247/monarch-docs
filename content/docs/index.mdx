## What is Monarch ORM?

**Monarch ORM** is a modern ODM/ORM for MongoDB, designed to provide a seamless and efficient way to interact with your MongoDB database in a type-safe manner. Monarch ensures that your data models are strictly enforced, reducing the risk of runtime errors and enhancing code maintainability.

## Why Monarch ORM?

Monarch ORM was born out of the need for better TypeScript support in MongoDB ORMs. While Mongoose has been a popular choice for many years, its type support often falls short, leading to potential runtime errors and reduced developer productivity. Inspired by the type-safe approach of Drizzle ORM for SQL databases, Monarch aims to bring the same level of type safety and developer experience to MongoDB users.

Key motivations behind Monarch ORM include:

1. **Strong TypeScript Support**: Monarch leverages TypeScript's type system to provide robust type checking and autocompletion, reducing errors and improving code quality.

2. **Improved Developer Experience**: With better type inference and stricter type checks, developers can catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime, leading to faster development cycles and fewer bugs.

3. **Modern API Design**: Taking cues from contemporary ORMs like Drizzle, Monarch offers a more intuitive and flexible API that aligns with modern JavaScript and TypeScript practices.

4. **Performance**: By focusing on MongoDB-specific features and optimizations, Monarch aims to provide better performance compared to more generic ODMs.

5. **Seamless Integration**: Monarch is designed to work smoothly with popular frameworks and tools in the Node.js ecosystem, making it easy to adopt in both new and existing projects.

By addressing these pain points, Monarch ORM strives to be the go-to choice for developers working with MongoDB in TypeScript environments, offering a balance of type safety, performance, and ease of use.


## Who should use Monarch?

Monarch ORM is ideal for:

1. **TypeScript Enthusiasts**: Developers who value strong type safety and want to leverage TypeScript's full potential in their MongoDB projects.

2. **Teams Seeking Reliability**: Organizations looking to reduce runtime errors and improve code maintainability in their database interactions.

3. **MongoDB Users Desiring Modern Tooling**: Those who appreciate MongoDB's flexibility but want a more contemporary, type-safe approach to working with their data.

4. **Developers Transitioning from SQL**: Engineers familiar with type-safe SQL ORMs like Drizzle who are moving to MongoDB-based projects.

5. **Performance-Conscious Developers**: Teams working on projects where database performance is crucial and who need an ORM optimized for MongoDB.

6. **Startups and Enterprises**: Both small teams and large organizations that prioritize code quality, developer productivity, and long-term maintainability.

7. **Full-Stack Developers**: Those working across the stack who want consistency and type safety in their backend data layer.

If you value type safety, need guardrails to prevent common errors, but still want to harness the flexibility of MongoDB, Monarch ORM is the perfect choice for your project.
